Ques: Given a bitonic sequence of n distinct elements, and an integer x, the task is to write a program to find given element x in 
the bitonic sequence.

Input :  arr[] = {-3, 9, 18, 20, 17, 5, 1}, key = 20
Output : Found at index 3

Input :  arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3, 2, 1}, key = 30
Output : -1

Soln: 

Idea:
 1.  Find the index of the peak/max element
 2. BS(arr,0,idx-1,asc) search here
 3. BS(arr,idx,size-1,desc) search here as well.



Note: Rotated sorted array != Bitonic Array
