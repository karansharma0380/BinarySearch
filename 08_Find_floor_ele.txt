Find the floor element of the target element.
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,8,10,10,12,19}, target=5

Soln: Finding the floor of target means finding the largest element amongst all the elements smaller than the target.


int BS(int[] arr, int target){
	int low=0;
	int high=arr.length-1;
	int flr = -1;

	while(low<=high){
		int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
	
		if(arr[mid]==target){
			return arr[mid];  // means floor(5) = 5 
		}
		else if(arr[mid]<target){
			flr=arr[mid]; // if the element is smaller than target, it is a candidate for floor of target
			low=mid+1; // after having the candidate move to the side which has larger element. 
		}
		else{
			high=mid-1;
		}
		
	}
	return flr;
}
