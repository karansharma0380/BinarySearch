Always on Sorted Array/Whenever there is a sorted array think of binary search


Code: This is Binary Search for the array which is sorted but in ascending order. 

int BS(int[] arr, int target){
	int low=0;
	int high=arr.length-1;

	while(low<=high){
		int mid = low + (high-low)/2;   // (2low + high -low)/2 -> (high+low)/2
		
		//If element is present at the middle itself
		if(arr[mid]==target){
			return mid;
		}

                // If the element is smaller than the middle element, then it can only be present in the left subarray
		if(arr[mid]>target){
			high=mid-1;
		}
		// Else the element can only be present in the right subarray
		else{
			low=mid+1;
		}
	}
	// If the element is not present in the array
	return -1;	
}
