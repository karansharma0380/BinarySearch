Find an element in a rotated sorted array
	    0  1  2  3  4 5 6 7
int[] arr= {11,12,13,14,2,5,7,8}

Soln:


1. Find the index of the smallest element
2. BS(arr, 0, idx-1)
3. BS(arr,idx, size-1)

from 2 and 3 either we will get and from any one of them or -1 from both of them.{means item is not there}
